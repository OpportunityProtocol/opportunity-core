# Smart Contract Module for Opportunity.  (Decentralized labor markets)
Opportunity is a decentralized protocol for labor markets focused on building infrastructure for the gig economy on Ethereum.  Deploy any market and find work regardless of geographical location or social class.

## Getting started ##
#### Motivation ####
Opportunity is a protocol for permission-less labor markets where users can find work and earn money in the simplest manner.  Anyone in the world can access and use Opportunity regardless of geographical location or social class.  User’s can deploy their own labor markets and all market payouts are settled in a decentralized currency known as DAI.  Disputes on the Opportunity platform are settled through Kleros, a decentralized arbitration platform.
