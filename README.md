# Smart Contract Module for Opportunity.  (Decentralized labor markets)
Opportunity is a decentralized protocol for labor markets focused on building structure for the gig economy on the blockchain.  Deploy any market and find work regardless of geographical location or social class.

## Getting started ##
#### Motivation ####
The Opportunity platform provides global and permission-less access for anyone to find work and earn money regardless of geographical location or social class.  It is not a labor market platform itself, but allows userâ€™s to deploy their own labor markets.  Anyone can participate in labor markets on Opportunity and instantly begin earning money.
